A) TERMS OF RDSDec USAGE
=========================

By running the RDS Decoder for Windows (following called "RDSDec") application you accept the following terms of usage.

RDSDec is protected by copyright laws and international copyright treaties, as well as other intellectual property laws and treaties. All rights are reserved. Reproduction in whole or in part is prohibited without the prior written consent of the copyright owner.

You may not reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble RDSDec, except and only to the extent that such activity is expressly permitted by applicable law notwithstanding this limitation.

Esslinger Data Engineering reserves the right to make changes without notice at any time. Esslinger Data Engineering makes no warranty, expressed, implied or statutory, including but not limited to any implied warranty of merchandibility or fitness for any particular purpose, or that the use will not infringe any third patent, copyright or trademark. Ingenieurbuero Esslinger is not liable for any loss or damage arising from its use. The entire risk arising out of use or performance of RDSDec remains with you.



B) SETUP
========

Installing RDSDec
-----------------
To install RDSDec, just copy the un-zipped files into one and the same directory. That's it!

Connecting your receiver
------------------------
Detailed information on how to connect your RDS receiver to the PC can be found in the help file, "Hardware: First Steps" section.

Please note that the RDS decoder application expects an RDS clock and data signal on the PC's COM port. RDSDec is not suitable for interacting with specific FM stereo receivers which might be equiped with a serial interface. In case you have such a receiver, ask the receiver manufacturer for possible software tools.
